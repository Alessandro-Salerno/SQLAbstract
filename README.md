## SQLAbstract
SQLAbstract is a small python library made from recycled code.
It implements the basic SQLite3 functions in an Object-Oriented way.
You can use the library to build small, unsafe and simple local databases, without writing a single line of SQL code. 
Just keep in mid that it was designed for personal use only, so use it at your own risk.

## Dependencies
SQLAbstract depends on `sqlite3` and `texttable`
You can get both with `pip` or `pip3`

## License
SQLAbstract is distributed under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.
Read `LICENSE` for more info.

## Code quality
SQLAbstract's code qulity is pretty poor as it was writte in a hurry a few years back.
I may or may not choose to clean the code in the future, feel free to fork and contribute if you can't stand this.
